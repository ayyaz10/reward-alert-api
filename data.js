There are three types of people in this world:
1. Leaders who want to lead and gain power.
2. Followers who want security and are afraid to take the lead.
3. The Rebels (the sigma of all) have no desire to have power over others but also do not tolerate another person having power over them.

Some people love freedom over everything they do.
Freedom in what we do and how we do it. We do not want authority hanging over our heads telling us what to do and what not to do. This book is about those people who want something out of their life, to follow their heart and soul rather than following what everyone is following.

‚ÄúThe Rebel Code‚Äù shares 12 steps to becoming the kind of person to free yourself from all foundations and boundaries and become a more charismatic and creative person.
The book will help you achieve true freedom.
